# CAT TOSS
*Adds cats that you can toss, what more could you want in life?*

This is a spigot plugin that adds one thing sorely to the game, a cat stick. **Allows you to shoot cats!**

## Guide
Get a block of white wool, place it down, let the fun begin~

### Cat stick
allows you to shoot cats without cooldown on commands, careful - there is a chance you keep the cat

## Warning
this plugin adds a powerful weapon that can be gained without any effort, making the game play unbalanced.
The plugin is also designed in a way to get players to first obtain the stick

ONLY add this plugin for fun!!
